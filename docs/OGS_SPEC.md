## Introduction

The Open Game System specification defines the protocols and APIs that allow web games to access native capabilities through the OGS ecosystem. This specification is designed to be:

- **Web-First**: Built for games that live primarily on the web
- **Protocol-Based**: Focused on defining clear communication protocols
- **Independent**: Allows games to maintain their own identity and authentication
- **Extensible**: Designed to accommodate future capabilities

The specification is implemented by the OGS platform and SDKs, which follow these protocols to enable cross-platform features.

## Core Specifications

The OGS v1 specification includes core protocols for: Account Linking, Push Notifications, TV Casting, and Cloud Rendering. Cloud Rendering is a foundational technology that powers both the TV Casting capabilities (via Cast Kit) and advanced rendering options for thin clients (via Stream Kit).

### Account Linking Protocol

The Account Linking Protocol enables games to link their independent user accounts with the OGS platform, enabling cross-platform features like push notifications while maintaining authentication independence.

#### Protocol Overview

1. Game server requests a link token from the OGS platform
2. User is redirected to the OGS platform's link account page with the link token
3. User authenticates with the OGS platform and confirms the link
4. OGS platform links the accounts and redirects back to the game
5. Game server verifies the link status with the OGS platform

#### HTTP Sequence for Account Linking

  "email": "user@example.com",
  "status": "linked",
  "linkedAt": "2024-06-29T15:35:00Z"
}
```

#### Web Auth Token Protocol

The Web Auth Token Protocol enables seamless single sign-on between the OGS platform and games, allowing users to access games through the OGS app without re-authenticating.

##### Protocol Overview

1. OGS app requests a web auth code from the OGS platform
2. OGS app opens the game in a WebView with the code as a parameter
3. Game server verifies the code with the OGS platform
4. OGS platform returns user information
5. Game creates a session for the user

##### HTTP Sequence for Web Auth Token

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "success": true,
  "sessionToken": "new-jwt-token",
  "expiresIn": 900
}
```

### Push Notification Protocol

Push notifications allow games to engage users even when they're not actively playing. The Push Notification Protocol defines how games can send notifications to users through the OGS platform.

#### Protocol Overview

1. Game server sends a notification request to the OGS platform
2. OGS platform verifies the game's API key and the account link
3. OGS platform delivers the notification to the user's device
4. OGS platform returns the delivery status to the game server
5. Game server can later check the notification status (delivered, read, etc.)

#### HTTP Sequence for Sending Notifications

### TV Casting Protocol

TV casting allows games to be displayed on larger screens while using mobile devices as controllers. Importantly, **Chromecast support is completely independent** and does NOT require Auth Kit or Notification Kit implementation.

#### Protocol Overview

1. Game server creates a cast session with the OGS platform
2. OGS platform initializes the receiver application on the Chromecast device
3. Game client switches to controller mode
4. Game client sends input events to the OGS platform
5. OGS platform forwards input events to the receiver application
6. When finished, game client ends the cast session

#### HTTP Sequence for Casting

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Game as Game Client
    participant OGS as OGS Platform
    participant Cast as Chromecast Device
    
    Game->>OGS: 1. Create Cast Session

    OGS->>Cast: 3. Initialize Receiver App
    Game->>Game: 4. Switch to Controller Mode
    Game->>OGS: 5. Send Input Events
    OGS->>Cast: 6. Forward Input Events
    Game->>OGS: 7. End Cast Session
    OGS->>Cast: 8. Terminate Receiver App
```

### Cloud Rendering Protocol

The Cloud Rendering Protocol enables games to offload intensive graphics rendering to powerful cloud servers and stream the output via WebRTC to the client. This protocol serves as the foundation for both TV casting (through Cast Kit) and selective cloud rendering (through Stream Kit).

Stream Kit specifically allows selective cloud rendering of specific graphics-intensive components while maintaining local rendering for UI elements, creating a hybrid rendering approach ideal for web games on thin clients with limited GPU capabilities.

This protocol is especially valuable for:
- Turn-based games requiring high-fidelity 3D graphics
- Games that need to support low-powered devices without compromising visual quality
- Experiences where consistent visual quality across all devices is important
- Games with graphically complex scenes that would benefit from powerful GPU rendering
- Dynamic AI-generated worlds that are procedurally created on demand
- TV casting via the Cast Kit

#### Stream Kit Architecture

The Stream Kit is built on a component-based architecture that allows developers to integrate cloud rendering selectively within their existing web games:

1. **StreamCanvas Component**: A client-side component that displays cloud-rendered content within your web UI
2. **Render Routes**: Standalone web pages optimized for cloud rendering that contain only the graphics-intensive elements
3. **Stream Session Management**: Handles negotiation between client and cloud rendering service
4. **WebRTC Pipeline**: Delivers low-latency video and audio streams from cloud to client

This architecture allows developers to:
- Render only specific components in the cloud rather than the entire application
- Compose multiple StreamCanvas instances in a single UI
- Maintain responsive local UI elements while offloading graphically intensive rendering
- Seamlessly switch between cloud and local rendering based on device capabilities

#### Implementation Strategy

Stream Kit is designed for progressive enhancement of web games:

1. **Standalone Route Creation**: Create dedicated routes in your web application that render only the graphics-intensive elements (3D scenes, complex visualizations, etc.)
2. **Component Integration**: Integrate the StreamCanvas component from stream-kit into your main UI where these elements should appear
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Implement logic to conditionally use cloud rendering based on device capabilities, user preferences, or specific high-fidelity needs
4. **Composition**: Combine multiple StreamCanvas instances to create rich, interactive experiences with different cloud-rendered views

This approach maintains your game's web-first nature while enhancing it with powerful cloud rendering capabilities.

#### Protocol Overview

1. **Client Initialization:** The game client (using `stream-kit`) initializes a StreamCanvas component with a render URL and options.
2. **Stream Request:** The StreamCanvas component requests a cloud rendering session from the OGS platform.
3. **Session Setup:** The OGS Platform authenticates the request, provisions a cloud rendering instance, and instructs it to load the specified render route URL.
4. **WebRTC Connection:** The OGS Platform facilitates WebRTC connection negotiation between the Cloud Rendering Instance and the Game Client.
5. **Streaming:** The Cloud Rendering Instance streams the captured video/audio directly to the Game Client via the established WebRTC connection.
6. **Local Input Handling:** The client can handle user interactions locally while displaying the cloud-rendered content.
7. **Input Forwarding (Optional):** For interactive streamed experiences, client input events can be forwarded to the cloud renderer.
8. **Session Termination:** The game client requests termination when done, and the OGS Platform tears down the Cloud Rendering Instance.

Host: api.opengame.org
Authorization: Bearer OGS_SESSION_TOKEN_OR_GAME_API_KEY 
```

Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "terminated",
  "sessionId": "stream-session-xyz789",
  "usage": {
    "duration": 1200, // seconds
    "dataTransferred": 450000000, // bytes
    "renderUnitTime": 20 // minutes of GPU time used
  }
}
```

##### WebSocket Signaling (Optional Alternative)

For WebRTC negotiation, a WebSocket connection between the Client, OGS Platform, and potentially the Renderer could be used instead of relying solely on HTTP polling/responses for SDP and ICE candidate exchange. This would be more efficient for the real-time nature of negotiation. The specific WebSocket message format would need further definition.

#### Stream Kit Integration Examples

##### Basic Integration (React)

```jsx
import { StreamCanvas } from '@open-game-system/stream-kit';

function GameView() {
  return (
    <div className="game-container">

}
```

##### Multiple View Integration

```jsx
import { StreamCanvas } from '@open-game-system/stream-kit';
import { useState } from 'react';
import * as Tabs from '@radix-ui/react-tabs';

function GameWithMultipleViews() {
  const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('world');
  
  return (
    <div className="game-container">
      <Tabs.Root value={activeView} onValueChange={setActiveView}>
        <Tabs.List className="view-selector">
          <Tabs.Trigger value="world">World</Tabs.Trigger>
          <Tabs.Trigger value="map">Map</Tabs.Trigger>
          <Tabs.Trigger value="character">Character</Tabs.Trigger>
        </Tabs.List>
        
        <Tabs.Content value="world" className="view-content">
          <StreamCanvas 
            url="https://yourgame.com/render/world-view"
            className="w-full h-full"
          />
        </Tabs.Content>
        
        <Tabs.Content value="map" className="view-content">
          <StreamCanvas 
            url="https://yourgame.com/render/map-view"
            className="w-full h-full"
          />
        </Tabs.Content>
        
        <Tabs.Content value="character" className="view-content">
          <StreamCanvas 
            url="https://yourgame.com/render/character-view"
            className="w-full h-full"
          />
        </Tabs.Content>
      </Tabs.Root>
      
      <div className="game-controls">
        {/* Common controls that work across all views */}
        <button>Inventory</button>
        <button>Menu</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

##### Conditional Cloud Rendering

```jsx
import { StreamCanvas } from '@open-game-system/stream-kit';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { LocalRenderer } from './components/LocalRenderer';
import { detectDeviceCapabilities } from './utils/deviceDetection';

function AdaptiveGameView() {
  const [useCloudRendering, setUseCloudRendering] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Detect if the device would benefit from cloud rendering
    const deviceCapabilities = detectDeviceCapabilities();
    
    setUseCloudRendering(
      deviceCapabilities.gpuTier < 2 || // Low-end GPU
      deviceCapabilities.isMobile ||    // Mobile device
      deviceCapabilities.preferCloudRendering // User preference
    );
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className="game-scene">
      {useCloudRendering ? (
        <StreamCanvas 
          url="https://yourgame.com/render/high-quality-scene"
          className="w-full h-full"
          renderOptions={{ quality: "high" }}
        />
      ) : (
        <LocalRenderer 
          scene="high-quality-scene"
          className="w-full h-full"
          quality={deviceCapabilities.gpuTier >= 3 ? "ultra" : "medium"}
        />
      )}
      
      <div className="overlay-controls">
        <button onClick={() => setUseCloudRendering(!useCloudRendering)}>
          Toggle Cloud Rendering
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Certification Process

To certify your game as OGS-compatible:

### 1. Domain Verification

Create a `.well-known/opengame-association.json` file at your domain root:

```json
{
  "appId": "your-game-id",
  "name": "Your Game Name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "contact": "developer@yourgame.com",
  "features": ["authentication", "notifications", "chromecast", "streaming"], 
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "verification": "VERIFICATION_TOKEN"
}
```

The `VERIFICATION_TOKEN` will be provided during certification. Include only the features you've implemented in the features array. The `apiVersion` field should match the version of the OGS API you're implementing (currently "v1").

### 2. Certification Flow

The certification process follows these steps:

1. Create the `.well-known/opengame-association.json` file on your domain
2. Trigger verification by submitting your domain to the OGS developer portal
3. Receive your API key by email after domain verification
4. Integrate the API key in your backend implementation
5. Test your implementation against the OGS platform
6. Submit your game for final review
7. Receive OGS certification after approval

### 3. API Key Generation

After successful domain verification, our automated system will send your API key to the contact email provided in the `.well-known` file:

* Keys are specific to each game and environment
* Store securely, never expose in client-side code
* Use the API key for server-to-server communication with the OGS platform

## SDKs for Implementation

The following SDKs implement the OGS protocols to simplify integration:

- **[auth-kit](https://github.com/open-game-system/auth-kit)**: Implementation of the Account Linking Protocol
- **[notification-kit](https://github.com/open-game-system/notification-kit)**: Implementation of the Push Notification Protocol
- **[cast-kit](https://github.com/open-game-system/cast-kit)**: Implementation of the TV Casting Protocol
- **[stream-kit](https://github.com/open-game-system/stream-kit)**: Implementation of the Cloud Rendering Protocol with components for integrating cloud-rendered graphics into web games

Each SDK can be used independently, allowing you to implement only the features your game needs.
